        The Imbalance of Culture Fit
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p class="bio"> Part of getting to a better place in the new year is
      recognizing where we have sway, and going past our own
      discomfort to create positive change in ourselves and
      in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring
      process can do better by thinking critically about
      culture fit. Matt Griffin challenges us to consider
      whether it actually creates the kind of team that’s the
      best for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us
      comfortable by surrounding us with people largely like
      ourselves in ways that aren’t relevant to the business.
